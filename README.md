<h1>Analog & Digital Project1</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project provides a basic understanding of the general principles that govern analogue and digital communications systems such as traditional analog communication techniques including AM, FM and modern digital systems techniques such as ASK, FSK and BPSK. In all these digital modulation techniques our analog signal is changed into binary numbers at each of our set frequencies(sample rates) the binary 1's and 0's are then transmitted to the intended recipient and converted back to the original signal form.
Shift Keying-Data modulation technique which allows you to transmit signals as binary inputs. 
FSK- In frequency shift keying, the frequency of the carrier signal varies with respect to the changes by the digital signal.
ASK- Amplitude of the carrier wave which is altered in accordance with the modulating signal.
BPSK- Referred to as the simplest form of phase shift keying using two signals separated by 180 degrees. Phase shift keying data is transmitted by a continuous reversal of the phase. In each of these steps, we modulated and demolulated the signal.

Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK):  <br/>
BPSK is commonly used in various communication systems, including wireless communication, satellite communication, and digital audio broadcasting. It is known for its simplicity and efficiency in transmitting binary data. One advantage of BPSK is that it is less susceptible to errors caused by noise or interference compared to some other modulation schemes. However, it may not be as bandwidth-efficient as more advanced modulation schemes in certain situations. BPSK is used to transmit binary data, where 0 and 1 are represented by different phases of the carrier signal. In BPSK, the carrier signal's phase is shifted by 180 degrees (π radians) for one of the binary values (usually 1), and there is no phase shift for the other binary value (usually 0). This means that the phase of the carrier wave changes between two states to represent the binary information. For binary 0: The carrier wave remains in its original phase.
For binary 1: The carrier wave's phase is inverted by 180 degrees.
